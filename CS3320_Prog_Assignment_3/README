Assumptions / Comments (if any):
	
# Is the program complete? Are there any assumptions made? Any other comments?
Yes the program is complete.

Approach :
# How do you solve this problem?
We first created an array that gives the chess piece which is present on a given position.
Then we changed the position on every move statement.
For storing the position, we have converted the 2D-positioning to a number by simply multiplying the 
row number with 8 and adding the column number i.e [2][4] will be 2*8+4 which helps to return the
position as a number. But in the input we have first column number (a-h) and then row number (1-8),
so if given [a][3] then we do 3*8+1. 
Whenever we move a chess piece from one position to another, we clear the previous position by putting
(' ') in it and write the chess piece character to destination position.

Assumptions / Comments (if any):
	
# Is the program complete? Are there any assumptions made? Any other comments?
Yes, the program is complete. We have assumed that the program will end with delay() statement as there will be some delay to display the digit.

Approach :
# How do you solve this problem?
We have made tokens for each keywords which are case-insensitive like select, if, delay etc. We have written
the rules to print the statements which can have select statements, if-else statements, delay statements.
Whenever we encounter a variable declaration, we print the declaration statement.
We have used tab characters for the proper indentation wherever required.
